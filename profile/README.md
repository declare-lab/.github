Welcome fellow researchers to the DeCLaRe Lab! We hereby **DeCLaRe** our quest to breathe _cognitive_ and _language_ skills of human-like depth into machines by solving challenging NLP problems, such as, dialogue comprehension and generation, commonsense reasoning, multimodal understanding, and more. Addressing such open research problems requires powerful, scalable, and data-hungry algorithms. As such, we develop cutting-edge neural models, based on sound linguistic concepts.
